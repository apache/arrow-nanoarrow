[![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/arrow-nanoarrow?branch=main)
[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-main-yellow)](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/)

The nanoarrow libraries are a set of helpers to produce and consume Arrow data,
including the
[Arrow C Data](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html),
[Arrow C Stream](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html),
and [Arrow C Device](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDeviceDataInterface.html),
structures and the
[serialized Arrow IPC format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#serialization-and-interprocess-communication-ipc).
The vision of nanoarrow is that it should be trivial for libraries to produce and consume
Arrow data: it helps fulfill this vision by providing high-quality, easy-to-adopt
helpers to produce, consume, and test Arrow data types and arrays.

The nanoarrow libraries were built to be:

- Small: nanoarrowâ€™s C runtime compiles into a few hundred kilobytes and its R and Python
  bindings both have an installed size of ~1 MB.
- Easy to depend on: nanoarrow's C library is distributed as two files (nanoarrow.c and
  nanoarrow.h) and its R and Python bindings have zero dependencies.
- Useful: The Arrow Columnar Format includes a wide range of data type and data encoding
  options. To the greatest extent practicable, nanoarrow strives to support the entire
  Arrow columnar specification (see the
  [Arrow implementation status](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/status.html) page for
  implementation status).

## Getting started

The nanoarrow Python bindings are available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/):

```sh
pip install nanoarrow
conda install nanoarrow -c conda-forge
```

The nanoarrow R package is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org):

```r
install.packages("nanoarrow")
```

See the [nanoarrow Documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/latest/) for
extended tutorials and API reference for the C, C++, Python, and R libraries.

- [Getting started in R](https://arrow.apache.org/nanoarrow/latest/getting-started/r.html)

The [nanoarrow GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow) additionally
provides a number of [examples](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/tree/main/examples)
covering how to use nanoarrow in a variety of build configurations.

## Development

### Building with CMake

CMake is the primary build system used to develop and test the nanoarrow C library. You can build
nanoarrow with:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Building nanoarrow with tests currently requires [Arrow C++](https://arrow.apache.org/install/).
If installed via a system package manager like `apt`, `dnf`, or `brew`, the tests can be
built with:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DNANOARROW_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build .
```

Tests can be run with `ctest`.

### Building with Meson

CMake is the officially supported build system for nanoarrow. However, the Meson
backend is an experimental feature you may also wish to try.

```sh
meson setup builddir
cd builddir
```

After setting up your project, be sure to enable the options you want:

```sh
meson configure -Dtests=true -Dbenchmarks=true
```

If Arrow is installed in a non-standard location on your system, you may need to
pass the `--pkg-config-path <path to directory with arrow.pc>` argument to either
the setup or configure steps above.

With the above out of the way, the `compile` command should take care of the rest:

```sh
meson compile
```

Upon a successful build you can execute the test suite and benchmarks with the
following commands:

```sh
meson test nanoarrow:  # default test run
meson test nanoarrow: --wrap valgrind  # run tests under valgrind
meson test nanoarrow: --benchmark --verbose # run benchmarks
```
