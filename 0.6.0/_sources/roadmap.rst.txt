Roadmap
=======

Apache Arrow nanoarrow is a relatively new library and is under active
development. Maintaining the balance between useful and minimal is
difficult to do; however, there are a number of features that fit
comforably within the scope of nanoarrow that have not yet been
scheduled for implementation.

C library
---------

-  **Type coverage**: The C library currently provides support for all
   types that are available via the Arrow C Data interface except string
   view/list view types. Support for these should be added in nanoarrow
   as well
   (`#583 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/583>`__,
   `#616 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/616>`__,
   `#510 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/510>`__).
-  **Remove Arrow C++ dependency for tests**: The C library and IPC
   extension rely on Arrow C++ for some test code that was written early
   in the library’s development. These tests are valuable to ensure
   compatibility between nanoarrow and Arrow C++; however, including
   them in the default test suite complicates release verification for
   some users and prevents testing in environments where Arrow C++ does
   not currently build (e.g., WASM, compilers without C++17 support)
   (`#619 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/619>`__).
-  **Test verbosity**: Tests for the C library were written before
   testing utilities in the ``nanoarrow_testing`` library were available
   (and before there was a ``nanoarrow_testing`` library in which to put
   new ones). As a result, some of them are very verbose and can be
   difficult to read, which can and should be improved
   (`#577 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/577>`__,
   `#566 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/566>`__).
-  **C++ integration**: The existing C++ integration is intentionally
   minimal; however, there are likely improvements that could be made to
   better integrate nanoarrow into existing C++ projects
   (`#599 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/599>`__).
-  **Documentation**: As the C library and its user base evolves,
   documentation needs to be refined and expanded to support the current
   set of use cases
   (`#187 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/187>`__,
   `#497 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/497>`__).
-  **IPC Dictionary support**: The IPC extension does not currently
   support reading dictionary messages an IPC stream
   (`#622 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/622>`__).
-  **IPC Compression support**: The IPC extension does not currently
   support compressed streams using per-buffer compression, although
   streams can be compressed outside the nanoarrow library (e.g., gzip
   compression of the entire stream)
   (`#621 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/621>`__)

R bindings
----------

-  **Conversion internals**: The initial implementation of conversion
   from Arrow data to R vectors was implemented in C and its verbosity
   makes it difficult to add support for new types. The internals should
   be refactored to make the conversion code easier to understand for
   new developers
   (`#392 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/pull/392>`__).
-  **Type support**: The R bindings currently rely on the Arrow R
   package for conversion of some R types (e.g., list_of), and some
   types are not supported in nanoarrow nor the arrow R package (e.g.,
   run-end encoding, list view, and string/binary view)
   (`#617 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/617>`__).
-  **ALTREP support**: A recent R release added enhanced ALTREP support
   such that types that convert to ``list()`` can defer materialization
   cost/allocation. Arrow sources that arrive in chunks (e.g., from a
   ``Table`` or ``ChunkedArray``) currently can’t be converted via any
   ALTREP mechanism and support could be added
   (`#219 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/219>`__).

Python bindings
---------------

-  **Type support**: The Python bindings do not currently support
   unions, string/binary view, or list view, or run-end-encoded types.
   When creating Arrow arrays from iterables of Python objects, some
   types are not yet supported (e.g., struct, list, datetime objects)
   (`#618 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/618>`__,
   `#620 <https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow/issues/620>`__).
