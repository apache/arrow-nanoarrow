# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
