#' Convert an object to a nanoarrow array_stream
#'
#' In nanoarrow, an 'array stream' corresponds to the `struct ArrowArrayStream`
#' as defined in the Arrow C Stream interface. This object is used to represent
#' a stream of [arrays][as_nanoarrow_array] with a common
#' [schema][as_nanoarrow_schema]. This is similar to an
#' [arrow::RecordBatchReader] except it can be used to represent a stream of
#' any type (not just record batches). Note that a stream of record batches
#' and a stream of non-nullable struct arrays are represented identically.
#' Also note that array streams are mutable objects and are passed by
#' reference and not by value.
#'
#' @param x An object to convert to a array_stream
#' @param ... Passed to S3 methods
#' @inheritParams as_nanoarrow_array
#'
#' @return An object of class 'nanoarrow_array_stream'
#' @export
as_nanoarrow_array_stream <- function(x, ..., schema = NULL) {
  UseMethod("as_nanoarrow_array_stream")
}

#' @export
as_nanoarrow_array_stream.nanoarrow_array_stream <- function(x, ..., schema = NULL) {
  if (is.null(schema)) {
    x
  } else {

}
