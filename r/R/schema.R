#' Convert an object to a nanoarrow schema
#'
#' In nanoarrow a 'schema' refers to a `struct ArrowSchema` as defined in the
#' Arrow C Data interface. This data structure can be used to represent an
#' [arrow::schema()], an [arrow::field()], or an `arrow::DataType`. Note that
#' in nanoarrow, an [arrow::schema()] and a non-nullable [arrow::struct()]
#' are represented identically.
#'
#' @param x An object to convert to a schema
#' @param ... Passed to S3 methods
#'
#' @return An object of class 'nanoarrow_schema'
#' @export
as_nanoarrow_schema <- function(x, ...) {
  UseMethod("as_nanoarrow_schema")
}

#' @export
as_nanoarrow_schema.nanoarrow_schema <- function(x, ...) {
  x
}
