# This script runs on R CMD build, which means it's the right place
# to vendor nanoarrow if we're in the nanoarrow repo. If we're not
# in the nanoarrow repo, this script should do nothing since it
# may also run in various capacities during R CMD INSTALL; however,
# we *do* want it to run on R CMD INSTALL *if* we're in the repo
# (so that the C library and the R package are always in sync).
