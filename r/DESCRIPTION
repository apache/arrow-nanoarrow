Description: Provides an 'R' interface to the 'nanoarrow' 'C' library and the
  'Apache Arrow' application binary interface. Functions to import and
  export 'ArrowArray', 'ArrowSchema', and 'ArrowArrayStream' 'C' structures
  to and from 'R' objects are provided alongside helpers to facilitate zero-copy
  data transfer among 'R' bindings to libraries implementing the 'Arrow' 'C'
  data interface.
