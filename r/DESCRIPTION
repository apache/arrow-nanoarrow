  'Apache Arrow' application binary interface. Functions to import and
  export 'ArrowArray', 'ArrowSchema', and 'ArrowArrayStream' C structures
  to and from R objects are provided alongside helpers to facilitate zero-copy
  data transfer among R bindings to libraries implementing the 'Arrow' C
  data interface.
