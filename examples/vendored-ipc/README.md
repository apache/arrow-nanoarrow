# IPC Extension Vendored Example

This folder contains a project that uses the bundled nanarrow and nanoarrow_ipc.c
files included in the dist/ directory of this repository (or that can be generated
using `cmake -DNANOARROW_BUNDLE=ON` from the root CMake project). Like the CMake
example, you must be careful to not expose nanoarrow's headers outside your project
and make use of `#define NANOARROW_NAMESPACE MyProject` to prefix nanoarrow's symbol
names to ensure they do not collide with another copy of nanoarrow potentially linked
to by another project.

The nanoarrow/ files included in this example are stubs to illustrate
how these files could fit in to a library and/or command-line application project.
The easiest way is to use the pre-generated versions in the dist/ folder of this
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow.git
cd arrow-nanoarrow/examples/vendored-ipc
mkdir -p src/nanoarrow
cp ../../dist/nanoarrow.h src/nanoarrow/nanoarrow.h
cp ../../dist/nanoarrow.c src/nanoarrow/nanoarrow.c
cp ../../dist/nanoarrow_ipc.h src/nanoarrow/nanoarrow_ipc.h
cp ../../dist/nanoarrow_ipc.c src/nanoarrow/nanoarrow_ipc.c
cp ../../dist/flatcc.c src/nanoarrow/flatcc.c
cp -r ../../dist/flatcc src/nanoarrow/flatcc
```

If you use these, you will have to manually `#define NANOARROW_NAMESPACE MyProject`
in nanoarrow.h.

You can also generate the bundled versions with the namespace defined using `cmake`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow.git
cd arrow-nanoarrow/examples/vendored-ipc

# First, build and install nanoarrow
mkdir build
pushd build
cmake ../../.. -DNANOARROW_BUNDLE=ON -DNANOARROW_NAMESPACE=ExampleVendored
cmake --build .
cmake --install . --prefix=../src/nanoarrow
popd

# Then, build and install nanoarrow_ipc
mkdir build_ipc
pushd build_ipc
cmake ../../.. -DNANOARROW_BUNDLE=ON -DNANOARROW_IPC=ON
cmake --build .
cmake --install . --prefix=../src/nanoarrow
popd
```

Then you can build/link the application/library using the build tool of your choosing:

```bash
cd src
cc -c library.c nanoarrow/nanoarrow.c nanoarrow/flatcc.c nanoarrow/nanoarrow_ipc.c -I./nanoarrow -I./nanoarrow/flatcc
ar rcs libexample_vendored_ipc_library.a library.o nanoarrow.o nanoarrow_ipc.o flatcc.o
cc -o example_vendored_ipc_app app.c libexample_vendored_ipc_library.a
```

You can test the command-line application using the two files
provided in the example directory:

```bash
cat ../schema-valid.arrows | ./example_vendored_ipc_app
cat ../invalid.arrows | ./example_vendored_ipc_app
# Expected 0xFFFFFFFF at start of message but found 0xFFFFFF00
```
