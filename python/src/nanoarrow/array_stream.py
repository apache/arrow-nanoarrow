    """High-level ArrayStream representation

    The ArrayStream is nanoarrow's high-level representation of zero
    or more contiguous arrays that have not neccessarily been materialized.
    This is in constrast to the nanoarrow :class:`Array`, which consists
    of zero or more contiguous arrays but is always fully-materialized.

    The :class:`ArrayStream` is similar to pyarrow's ``RecordBatchReader``
    except it can also represent streams of non-struct arrays. Its scope
    maps to that of an``ArrowArrayStream`` as represented by the Arrow C
    Stream interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : array or array stream-like
        An array-like or array stream-like object as sanitized by
        :func:`c_array_stream`.
    schema : schema-like, optional
        An optional schema, passed to :func:`c_array_stream`.
