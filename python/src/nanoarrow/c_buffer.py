def c_buffer(obj, schema=None) -> CBuffer:
    """Owning, read-only ArrowBuffer wrapper

    If obj implements the Python buffer protocol, ``c_buffer()`` wraps
    obj in nanoarrow's owning buffer structure, the ArrowBuffer,
    such that it can be used to construct arrays. The ownership of the
    underlying buffer is handled by the Python buffer protocol
    (i.e., ``PyObject_GetBuffer()`` and ``PyBuffer_Release()``).

    If obj is iterable, a buffer will be allocated and populated with
    the contents of obj according to ``schema``. The
    ``schema`` parameter is required to create a buffer from
    a Python iterable. The ``struct`` module is currently used to encode
    values from obj into binary form.

    Unlike with :func:`c_array`, ``schema`` is explicitly
    honoured (or an error will be raised).

    Parameters
    ----------

    obj : buffer-like or iterable
        A Python object that supports the Python buffer protocol. This includes
        bytes, memoryview, bytearray, bulit-in types as well as numpy arrays.
    schema :  schema-like, optional
        The data type of the desired buffer as sanitized by
        :func:`c_schema`. Only values that make sense as buffer types are
        allowed (e.g., integer types, floating-point types, interval types,
        decimal types, binary, string, fixed-size binary).

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import nanoarrow as na
    >>> na.c_buffer(b"1234")
    nanoarrow.c_lib.CBuffer(uint8[4 b] 49 50 51 52)
    >>> na.c_buffer([1, 2, 3], na.int32())
    nanoarrow.c_lib.CBuffer(int32[12 b] 1 2 3)
