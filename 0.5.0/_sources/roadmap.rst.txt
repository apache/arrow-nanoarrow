Roadmap
=======

Apache Arrow nanoarrow is a relatively new library and is under active
development. Maintaining the balance between useful and minimal is
difficult to do; however, there are a number of features that fit
comforably within the scope of nanoarrow that have not yet been
scheduled for implementation.

C library
---------

-  **Type coverage**: The C library currently provides support for all
   types that are available via the Arrow C Data interface. When the
   recently-added run-end encoded (REE) types and potentially
   forthcoming string view/list view types are available via the Arrow C
   Data interface, support should be added in nanoarrow as well.
-  **Array append**: The ``ArrowArrayAppend*()`` family of functions
   provide a means by which to incrementally build arrays; however,
   there is no built-in way to append an ``ArrowArrayView``, potentially
   more efficiently appending multiple values at once. Among other
   things, this would provide a route to an unoptimized filter/take
   implementation.
-  **Remove Arrow C++ dependency for tests**: The C library and IPC
   extension rely on Arrow C++ for some test code that was written early
   in the library’s development. These tests are valuable to ensure
   compatibility between nanoarrow and Arrow C++; however, including
   them in the default test suite complicates release verification for
   some users and prevents testing in environments where Arrow C++ does
   not currently build (e.g., WASM, compilers without C++17 support).
-  **C++ integration**: The existing C++ integration is intentionally
   minimal; however, there are likely improvements that could be made to
   better integrate nanoarrow into existing C++ projects.
-  **Documentation**: As the C library and its user base evolves,
   documentation needs to be refined and expanded to support the current
   set of use cases.

IPC extension
-------------

-  **Write support**: The IPC extension currently provides support for
   reading IPC streams but not writing them.
-  **Dictionary support**: The IPC extension does not currently support
   reading dictionary messages an IPC stream.
-  **Compression**: The IPC extension does not currently support
   compressed streams.

Device extension
----------------

This entire extension is currently experimental and awaiting use-cases
that will drive future development.

R bindings
----------

-  **Type support**: The R bindings currently do not provide support for
   extension types and relies on Arrow C++ for some dictionary-encoded
   types.
-  **ALTREP support**: A recent R release added enhanced ALTREP support
   such that types that convert to ``list()`` can defer materialization
   cost/allocation. Arrow sources that arrive in chunks (e.g., from a
   ``Table`` or ``ChunkedArray``) currently can’t be converted via any
   ALTREP mechanism and support could be added.
-  **IPC support**: The IPC reader is not currently exposed in the R
   bindings.

Python bindings
---------------

-  **Packaging**: The Python bindings are currently unpublished (pypi or
   conda) and are not included in release verification.
-  **Element conversion**: There is currently no mechanism to extract an
   element of an ``ArrowArrayView`` as a Python object (e.g., an ``int``
   or ``str``).
-  **numpy/Pandas conversion**: The Python bindings currently expose the
   ``ArrowArrayView`` but do not provide a means by which to convert to
   popular packages such as numpy or Pandas.
-  **Creating arrays**: The Python bindings do not currently provide a
   means by which to create an ``ArrowArray`` from buffers or
   incrementally.
-  **IPC support**: The IPC reader is not currently exposed in the
   Python bindings.
